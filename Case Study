Case Study: Remote Deposit Capture
1. Recently, several banks have started offering customers remote deposit capture. With
this new service, customers do not have to physically go to banks or ATM machines to
deposit checks anymore. Instead, they can send checks as a scanned image through an
Internet portal provided by the bank.
2. This technology can save banks and customers time and money making the
transactions. Blue Bank is considering implementing this new service.
3. To use it, customers need a remote capture account with Blue Bank. In addition, they
can either download an app on their phone or they need to install a browser plugin to
use any general purpose scanner attached to their computer. The customer will be
prompted to install the browser plugin when customer tries to deposit checks using
bank’s internet portal.
4. Once the account is established in the system and customer has setup the mobile phone
or browser plugin, customers will be able to scan all of their checks anytime and
anywhere by using the bank mobile app or by accessing the bank’s Internet portal,
logging in, and scanning the checks.
5. The service should be as easy as sending an attachment in an email. Of course, this
new application has to be very reliable, secure, and easy to use. It must be integrated
into the current Blue Bank Web site, and the Web site must also provide the ability for
customers to purchase the general purpose pre-tested scanners.
6. Blue Bank will set up the scanner-purchasing ability with several appropriate hardware
vendors and sell the devices at its physical banks as well.
7. Blue Bank is not sure yet what to charge for the scanners or service. The Website will
also provide online technical support and instructions showing customers how to setup
and use the new scanner and service. Support will be provided 24/7 via the Web site
and telephone.
8. Several managers at Blue Bank are not sure that they should invest in remote deposit
capture. The bank prides itself on being customer-oriented, having several large bank
buildings, ATMs and remote bank sites in many grocery stores, primarily throughout the
Midwest. Many of its customers have banked with Blue Bank their whole lives, but less
than half of them use any of its current Internet banking services.
9. The new VP of IT was hired to prepare Blue Bank for the future and to reduce the loss of
younger customers who have moved to banks that are more progressive.
10. Initial​ ​estimates​ suggests that the project will take 6 months to complete and cost about
$500,000. Annual operating costs would be about $150,000 per year for three years.
Estimated benefits are about $400,000 per year for three years.
11. Harold Johnson, the project sponsor, had told you that you​ ​will​ ​be​ ​leading​ ​this​ ​project
and it is important to finish on time and within budget, but it is even more important to
provide a high-quality service and avoid any potential technical or user problems after
implementation. Blue Bank wants to attract new customers with remote deposit capture
and avoid losing current customers, so quality and customer service is key.
12. The​ ​team​ to work on this project has 4 developers, 2 testers. Most of the developers and
testers has offices on different floors of the building and generally works in their office.
13. The​ ​team​ ​members​ have some experience​ i​ n web development but none in mobile
development. Nobody on team has performance testing experience or User experience
expertise. Also, since this is the first agile project for the team, they are not familiar with
engineering practices like automated testing, continuous integration, etc.
14. The​ ​Business​ ​stakeholders​ who wrote the high level vision for the mobile application
are going to help refine or define the user needs. They currently sit in different building.
They are working on writing detailed requirements and planning to hand-off to you in 2
weeks.
15. Your peers have suggested that you want to be sure that the project will please key
stakeholders, in particular Harold, the project sponsor, and Tricia, the VP of Marketing.
Both of these senior managers are very aware of customers’ needs, so it is important
that the new service is stable, secure, and easy to use.
16. They both want the remote deposit capture capability to be ready as soon as possible so
the company can start promoting this new service.
17. High​ ​Level​ ​Vision​: Here are the High Level Vision for the Remote Deposit Capture:
18. Using the​ ​new​ ​mobile​ ​app,​ ​Blue Bank customers can:
a. Download an app for iPhone, android phones, windows phones

Blue Bank has always used the traditional waterfall method to deliver IT projects.  Harold Johnson and the company leadership have suggested that you also use traditional methods to build the software.  You have a different idea.  You think agile would be better for this situation. 

In the space below, make a case to Harold as to why we should switch to agile (explain why using agile is a better choice for this project/situation).  Be sure to support your argument by referring back to the case study text.
ChatGPT
Dear Harold Johnson,

I understand that Blue Bank has traditionally used the waterfall method for IT projects, and there may be a preference to continue with this approach for the remote deposit capture project. However, I strongly believe that adopting agile methodology would be more beneficial for several reasons, particularly considering the unique aspects and requirements outlined in the case study.

Flexibility and Iterative Development:

Agile methodology allows for iterative development and continuous improvement based on feedback. Given that this project introduces a new technology to Blue Bank's service offerings, the ability to adapt and refine the software based on early user feedback and changing market conditions is crucial. As stated in the case study, "quality and customer service is key." Agile's iterative approach ensures that we can deliver a high-quality service that meets customer expectations through ongoing iterations and refinements.
Customer-Centric Approach:

The remote deposit capture service aims to attract new customers and retain existing ones by offering convenience and reliability. Agile methodology promotes a customer-centric approach by involving stakeholders, including business and marketing, in regular feedback loops. This ensures that the software development aligns closely with customer needs and expectations. As mentioned, both you and Tricia emphasize stability, security, and ease of use—qualities that agile development can address through its focus on incremental delivery and frequent validation with stakeholders.
Early and Continuous Delivery:

Agile enables early and continuous delivery of working software. This means that we can deploy functional components of the remote deposit capture service sooner, allowing Blue Bank to start promoting and gaining traction with customers earlier than with a traditional waterfall approach. This aligns with your goal to have the capability ready for promotion as soon as possible, accelerating time to market and potentially reducing the risk of losing customers to more progressive banks.
Mitigating Risks and Embracing Change:

The case study highlights challenges such as the team's lack of experience in mobile development and certain technical areas. Agile methodologies encourage adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, which can mitigate risks associated with such challenges. It allows us to address uncertainties and technical gaps incrementally, rather than waiting until the end of a lengthy development cycle as in waterfall.
Team Collaboration and Empowerment:

Agile promotes cross-functional teams and close collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders. This is particularly advantageous given the diverse skill sets and expertise needed for this project, as outlined in the case study. By working in small, self-organizing teams and fostering a culture of collaboration, we can leverage the strengths of each team member and collectively work towards achieving project success.
In conclusion, while the waterfall approach has its merits, I believe that agile methodology is better suited for the remote deposit capture project at Blue Bank. It aligns with our goals of delivering a high-quality, customer-oriented service efficiently and effectively. Agile's emphasis on flexibility, iterative development, customer feedback, and collaboration addresses the specific needs and challenges outlined in the case study. I am confident that adopting agile will not only help us meet our objectives for this project but also position Blue Bank as a leader in innovation and customer satisfaction within the banking industry.

I look forward to discussing this further and exploring how we can successfully transition to agile for this important initiative.

Dear Harold,

Thank you for your agreement to proceed with agile methodology for the remote deposit capture project. Transitioning to agile will bring about several changes in how the team operates and how key stakeholders engage, ensuring the success of this initiative.

Changes in Team Operations:
Team Structure:

The team will be organized into cross-functional, self-organizing units comprising developers, testers, and possibly additional roles like UX specialists or performance testers as needed. This structure promotes collaboration and collective ownership of deliverables.
Iterative Development:

Instead of a linear, sequential approach, the team will work in short, time-boxed iterations (typically 2-4 weeks). Each iteration will deliver a potentially shippable product increment, starting with the most critical features and progressively building upon them.
Daily Stand-ups:

The team will conduct daily stand-up meetings (or scrums) to synchronize activities, discuss progress, and identify any impediments. These brief meetings foster transparency, communication, and quick issue resolution.
Continuous Feedback and Adaptation:

Agile encourages frequent feedback loops with stakeholders. This means regular demos or showcases of completed functionality, allowing stakeholders to provide feedback early and often. This feedback informs subsequent iterations and ensures alignment with business goals.
Changes in Stakeholder Engagement:
Active Participation:

Stakeholders, including yourself, Tricia, and other business leaders, will be actively involved throughout the project. This involvement includes attending sprint reviews, providing feedback on deliverables, and prioritizing features based on business value.
Prioritization and Flexibility:

Agile allows for flexibility in prioritizing features based on changing market conditions or customer feedback. Stakeholders will need to engage in regular prioritization sessions to ensure that the team is delivering the most valuable functionality early in the project lifecycle.
Clear Communication Channels:

Effective communication channels will be established to facilitate continuous dialogue between the team and stakeholders. This ensures that any changes in requirements or business priorities are communicated promptly and understood by all parties.
Training and Support Needs:
Given that the team is new to agile, here are the specific support needs:

Agile Training:

The team will benefit from comprehensive agile training to familiarize themselves with agile principles, roles (such as Scrum Master and Product Owner), ceremonies (like sprint planning and retrospectives), and best practices. This foundational training will ensure that everyone is aligned on agile concepts and methodologies.

Harold is pretty impressed by your response and has approved all of your recommendations in previous two responses. He then re-iterated the key criteria for success and asked you if he and his management team should expect anything different from this project in terms for tracking and status updates.



Are there any project constraints laid out in the case study that need to be changed/managed since you will be using agile and, in agile, planning, estimation and tracking happens differently? 

Hint: The case study implies certain project constraints/expectations around cost, timeline, other factors that need to managed/changed.
ChatGPT
In transitioning to agile methodology for the remote deposit capture project at Blue Bank, there are indeed several project constraints and expectations that will need to be managed differently compared to traditional waterfall approaches:

Constraints and Expectations in the Case Study:
Cost Management:

Traditional Expectation: Typically, in a waterfall approach, costs are estimated upfront and allocated across distinct phases of the project (e.g., analysis, design, development, testing). Changes to scope or requirements often result in change requests and adjustments to the budget.
Agile Approach: Agile projects embrace change and prioritize delivering maximum value. Cost management in agile involves frequent reassessment of priorities and budget allocation based on evolving requirements and feedback. Instead of a fixed budget allocated upfront, agile budgets are more flexible and adaptive to changes in scope and priorities over time.
Timeline and Delivery:

Traditional Expectation: Waterfall projects typically have a fixed timeline with milestones and deliverables planned at the outset. Adjustments to timelines are less common and may require significant renegotiation or restructuring of the project plan.
Agile Approach: Agile projects deliver in iterations (sprints), with each sprint producing potentially shippable increments of the product. Timelines are more flexible and adaptable to changes in scope and priorities. Agile teams focus on delivering incremental value regularly, rather than adhering strictly to a predetermined project schedule. This allows for earlier delivery of valuable features and more responsive management of project timelines.
Risk Management:

Traditional Expectation: Waterfall projects typically address risks upfront during the planning phase, with risk mitigation strategies defined and implemented early in the project lifecycle.
Agile Approach: Agile embraces an iterative approach to risk management. Risks are continuously identified, assessed, and mitigated throughout the project. Agile teams prioritize high-risk items early in the project, addressing them in early sprints to minimize potential impacts on project success.
Changes and Management in Agile:
Planning and Estimation:

Agile planning involves collaborative effort among the team and stakeholders to prioritize work items based on business value. Estimations are done at a high level initially and refined iteratively as the team gains more clarity and understanding of the work. Unlike detailed upfront planning in waterfall, agile planning is dynamic and responsive to changing requirements and priorities.
Tracking Progress:

Agile projects track progress differently from waterfall. Instead of relying solely on predefined milestones, agile teams use burn-down charts, sprint burndown charts, and other metrics to monitor progress within each iteration. Progress is transparently visible through daily stand-ups and sprint reviews, ensuring stakeholders are continuously informed about project status and any adjustments needed.
Customer and Stakeholder Engagement:

Agile encourages frequent interaction with stakeholders and customers to gather feedback on product increments. This ongoing engagement ensures alignment with business objectives and allows for timely adjustments based on stakeholder input. Stakeholders should expect more frequent opportunities to review and provide feedback on evolving deliverables.
Conclusion:
Harold and the management team should expect a shift in how project progress, costs, and timelines are managed with the adoption of agile. While agile provides flexibility and responsiveness to change, it requires active engagement from stakeholders and a mindset focused on delivering incremental value throughout the project lifecycle. By embracing agile principles and practices, Blue Bank can effectively navigate the complexities of the remote deposit capture project, delivering a high-quality service that meets customer expectations and business goals.
